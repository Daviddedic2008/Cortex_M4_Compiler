-- TODO --

* [being worked on]


* add register file snapshot storing/restoring before and after conditionals(if/else, while)
* add else, continue, break
* make it so equal opcode always writes to new register instead of just returning old regs
	e.g. x = y, have it copy value of y from one reg to another. dont just lazily return the regs y is already in.
	to remedy the performance hit possibly add aliases for people who wanna have multiple variable names for one
* add logical and, or, not
* add bitwise not
* make sure backpatching uses proper bit packing
* add increment and decrement ops, of type += and -=. These should write back to old registers instead of always finding new ones
